Hello!

I am Steven Frederick and I just finished my 3rd year at MSU and I am studying Media and Information with a concentration in Interactive/Social Media. I play basketball and football but mainly stick to basketball because I enjoy it more. I am the youngest in my family which is hard to believe. I want to be sucessful but I also want to enjoy what I do for a living as well. I play PS4 a bit and play games such as NBA 2k, GTA V, and Call of Duty.
